# Studyplan-Creator

## Infos

This is my first Node.js project. It is a simple website which allows one user to create a studyplan and to create modules.
To use this project it's important to install npm.

To run the server just enter into your console (in the project folder): npm run build && npm run start

This will start a server at the port 8080.

## What I Learned
- Creating a basic structure of a Node.js project 
- Dynamically update a Website-UI
- Using JavaScript in gerneral
- Using node.js modules like browserify etc.
